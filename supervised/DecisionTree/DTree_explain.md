## Construction of Decision Tree

A tree can be “learned” by splitting the source set into subsets based on an attribute value test. 

- This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. 

- __The recursion is completed when the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable, or when splitting no long
er adds value to the predictions.__

- The construction of decision tree classifier __does not require any domain knowledge or parameter setting__, and therefore 
is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery. 

- Decision trees can handle high dimensional data. In general decision tree classifier has good accuracy. Decision tree induction is a typical inductive approach to learn knowledge on classification.
